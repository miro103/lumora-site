    <p class="mb-4">
        In the twilight ruins of Aleya, a war-scarred city where hope flickers like dying embers,
        a girl named Lina searches for her lost brother. Holding only a glowing crystal left behind by their mother,
        she ventures into the forbidden sectors. There, whispers of rebellion and echoes of past dreams guide her.
        This story is about love, sacrifice, and a single light that could awaken the soul of a forgotten world.
    </p>
    <p>
        Lina’s journey is not only to find her brother—but to ignite the final spark in a place where light had once died.
        Can she overcome the silence, shadows, and secrets buried in the dust?

        Before the war, Aleya was a city of music. Birds sang with the rising sun, merchants laughed in the streets,
        and children played to the rhythm of peace. This story returns to those golden days—through the eyes of Youssef,
        a young boy with a violin and dreams of performing on stage.

        As we follow Youssef's memories, we feel the warmth of his family, the scent of jasmine in the courtyard,
        and the echo of songs now silenced. But even in tragedy, memories sing—and remind us that home is more than a place;
        it’s a sound carried in the heart.
